# Weather App - Key Points

1. **Purpose**: A web application to fetch and display real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - User enters a city name and submits the form.
   - Displays temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, weather description, and an icon.
   - Shows a loading spinner while fetching data.
   - Handles errors (e.g., invalid city, network issues) with user-friendly messages.

3. **Backend**:
   - Built with Python and Flask.
   - `/weather` endpoint receives city name, fetches data from OpenWeatherMap, and returns JSON with weather details.
   - Serves static files: `index.html` (main page) and `style.css` (styling).

4. **API Integration**:
   - Uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data.
   - API key and endpoint are configured in the backend.
   - Data is returned in metric units (Celsius, m/s).

5. **UI/UX**:
   - Modern, responsive design with a centered container.
   - Animated loading spinner and weather icon.
   - Smooth transitions for displaying results.
   - Mobile-friendly layout.

6. **How to Run**:
   - Start the Flask server (`python main.py`).
   - Open the app in a browser (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
   - Enter a city name and view the weather details.

7. **Files**:
   - `index.html`: Frontend UI and JavaScript logic.
   - `style.css`: Styling for the app.
   - `main.py`: Flask backend and API logic.
   - `readme.md`: Project documentation (this file).

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Displays error messages for missing city input, API errors, or network issues.

9. **Customization**:
   - You can change the API key in `main.py`.
   - UI can be customized via `style.css`.
